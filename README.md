##Exercise
-
Develop the APIs for a simple To-do-list application. The requirements are -
1. There should be a very simple user registration module - (Just name, email and
password only).
2. Registered users should be able to login.
3. LoggedIn users can add tasks to his "To-do List". (A task is nothing but a simple
item, with a title, a short description, a status, and an optional file upload (PDF and Image
only. By default, the status of a todo item should be "To do")
4. Logged In user should be able to list the list of tasks added by him.
5. Logged In user can edit or delete his tasks.
6. Logged In user can update the status of the task as ("In Progress" or "Done")
